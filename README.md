# CRUD app

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests respectively). This is what each operation does:


Create (POST) — Make something

Read (GET)- Get something

Update (PUT) — Change something

Delete (DELETE)- Remove something


# Post

is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

# Get

is used to request data from a specified resource.

# Put

Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

# Delete

Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URI.
